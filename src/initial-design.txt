Two components, Grid and tetris
Grid simply takes a 2d array of 1s and 0s and highlights the 1s

tetris has two state variables
frozen grid and currentShape (shape_function, col, row, rotation)
when tetris renders, it renders both
    -take a copy of frozen grid
    -use shape_function(col, row, rotation) to get indices
    -set the indices onto the copy
    -pass that to Grid

changing position or rotation...
first we generate the new indices
if there is an intersection, break (do nothing)
else set the new position or rotation
SPECIAL CASE
if moving down
if there is an intersection
freeze shape
generate new shape

So, we need a function for each shape which returns a set of indices
based on its position (col, row) and its rotation

We need a function for freeze shape (just merge it onto frozen grid)
We need a function for generating a new shape (choose random shape, col, and rotation. row should be 
0 or something)
We need a setInterval which calls moveShapeDown whose speed increases over time
We need a function which checks for match
We need a function which removes a row 


// returns the indices of shape positioned at i,j
shape(i, j)
shapes include...
square, line, el_l, el_r, tee, zee_r, zee_l
need better names

The top row is going to have index 0
The bottom row is going to have index BOARD_HEIGHT
We can have hidden rows (ie indices which can be filled but aren't rendered)
