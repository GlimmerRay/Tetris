A 'Grid' takes a 2d array of 1s and 0s and renders
a table of colored accordingly

Tetris has a 'staticGrid' and a 'shape'
'staticGrid' keeps track of the active cells which are unmoving
'shape' keeps track of the active cells which are currently moving
a 'shape' is simply a set of indices
'shape' functions are used to generate shapes
they only take a center
each render needs to display 'shape' and 'staticGrid'
since they are stored separately, they need to be joined
'joinShapeGrid' returns a new 2d array which is a joined version of 'staticGrid' and 'shape'
When the component mounts, we set an interval function decrementShapeCenter
which constantly moves state.shape down the screen
decrementShapeCenter checks for collisions using collides()
If there is a collision, it adds the current shape to staticGrid and generates
a new moving shape at the top of the Grid
a collision occurs when the potential new shape shares an index with staticGrid
or has an out of bounds y position
